# MLOps / AI Infrastructure Portfolio – Bhargava Bokkena

Hi, I'm **Bhargava** — a DevOps Engineer (7+ years) transitioning into **MLOps / AI Infrastructure / LLMOps**.

This portfolio showcases the projects I am building during my intensive transition training, including:

- **End-to-End ML Pipeline (Project 1)**
- **RAG / LLM System (Project 2)**
- **Monitoring + Drift Detection + Retraining (Project 3)**

These projects focus on cloud deployment, automation, model serving, monitoring, and building production-grade AI systems.

## 🔧 Skills (Growing & Actively Being Developed)

### **DevOps / Cloud (Strong Foundation)**
- AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  
- Monitoring, logging, automation  
- Linux, networking, scripting  

### **MLOps / AI (In Progress During Training)**
